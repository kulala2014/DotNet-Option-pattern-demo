# DotNet-Option-pattern-demo
This repo is used to learn option pattern in .net core.
### The options pattern uses classes to provide strongly typed access to groups of related settings. When configuration settings are isolated by scenario into separate classes, the app adheres to two important software engineering principles:

Encapsulation:
Classes that depend on configuration settings depend only on the configuration settings that they use.
Separation of Concerns:
Settings for different parts of the app aren't dependent or coupled to one another.
Options also provide a mechanism to validate configuration data. For more information, see the Options validation section.
